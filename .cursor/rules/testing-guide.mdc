# Testing Guide

Tests for the `JiraScope` project are located in the `[tests/](mdc:tests)` directory.

## Structure

*   `tests/integration`: Integration tests.
*   `tests/unit`: Unit tests.
*   `tests/fixtures`: Test fixtures, see `[tests/fixtures/analysis_fixtures.py](mdc:tests/fixtures/analysis_fixtures.py)`.
*   `[tests/conftest.py](mdc:tests/conftest.py)` contains shared pytest fixtures.

## Running Tests

Tests are likely run using `pytest`. Look for test configurations in `[pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml)`.
