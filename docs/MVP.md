# JiraScope RAG Agent - MVP Definition

## Motive

JiraScope transforms your Jira workspace into an **intelligent, semantic knowledge base** that AI models can understand and query naturally. Instead of manually searching through hundreds of tickets, writing complex JQL queries, or losing context across Epic hierarchies, JiraScope creates a **living semantic map** of your project work.

### The Problem

**Current Jira Pain Points:**
- **Information Silos**: Knowledge trapped in individual tickets with no semantic connections
- **Manual Pattern Detection**: Teams manually identify duplicate work, tech debt clusters, and scope drift
- **Context Loss**: No understanding of relationships between Epics, Stories, and Tasks
- **Time-Consuming Analysis**: Hours spent manually correlating tickets for retrospectives and planning
- **Knowledge Gaps**: New team members can't easily understand project history and context

### The Solution

**JiraScope RAG Agent** creates a semantic layer over your Jira data, enabling:
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask "What technical debt issues are blocking the mobile app?"
- **Automatic Pattern Detection**: Find similar issues, duplicate work, and related stories
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Understand Epic hierarchies and cross-project dependencies
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Generate reports, identify risks, and suggest optimizations

## Core Use Cases

### 1. **Project Health Analysis**
**Query**: *"Show me all high-priority bugs introduced in the last sprint that might affect our Q4 release"*
- Semantic search across tickets by priority, type, and time
- Cross-reference with Epic timelines and dependencies
- Identify potential release blockers before they escalate

### 2. **Technical Debt Management**
**Query**: *"Find all infrastructure stories that mention performance issues and group by component"*
- Detect recurring themes across different tickets
- Cluster related technical debt by system component
- Prioritize refactoring efforts based on impact and frequency

### 3. **Scope Drift Detection**
**Query**: *"Which Epics have expanded beyond their original scope and by how much?"*
- Compare original Epic descriptions with current Story content
- Track scope creep through semantic analysis
- Quantify effort inflation across time periods

### 4. **Cross-Team Dependencies**
**Query**: *"What work items are waiting on the Platform team and what's the estimated impact on delivery?"*
- Map dependencies between teams and components
- Identify bottlenecks and critical path items
- Surface hidden dependencies not captured in Jira links

### 5. **Knowledge Discovery**
**Query**: *"How did we solve the authentication caching issue last year? Show me related discussions and solutions"*
- Semantic search across historical tickets
- Find solutions to similar problems from the past
- Accelerate problem-solving through institutional knowledge

### 6. **Sprint Planning Intelligence**
**Query**: *"Based on past velocity and current commitments, what's the realistic scope for next sprint?"*
- Analyze historical patterns and team capacity
- Identify stories with hidden complexity
- Optimize sprint planning with data-driven insights
